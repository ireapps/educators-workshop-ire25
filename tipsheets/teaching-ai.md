# What I learned from teaching AI
From the desk of a professor who dove into teaching an introductory class in AI and made it up as she went. It was both stressful and fun. 

### Texts and readings
-    I used Meredith Broussard's [Artificial Unintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Unintelligence-Computers-Misunderstand-World/dp/0262038005) as the main text for the class. It came out in 2018 and so doesn't speak to the current AI arms race, but Broussard does fundamentally understand how AI works (and how computers work, and how data journalism works) and most of my students felt empowered by getting this inside look into technology. 
-    I kept an eye on a lot of what the [AP is doing with AI](https://www.ap.org/solutions/artificial-intelligence/)
-    I used and referenced Joe Amditis's helpful guides, such as the [Beginner's prompt handbook](https://jamditis.notion.site/Beginner-s-prompt-handbook-ChatGPT-for-local-news-publishers-15d1f07d5b194265a41fdd42955679b4) and [Custom GPTs for local newsrooms](https://jamditis.notion.site/Beginner-s-guide-Custom-GPTs-for-local-news-publishers-dd36d47275e34aacbc648f7fa926c2bc). 
-   I subscribed to the [Superhuman](https://www.superhuman.ai/) newsletter, which is a lot of hype but helps you keep an eye on what's happening at the cutting edge.
-   I also subscribed to Jeremy Caplan's newsletter [Wonder Tools](https://wondertools.substack.com/) which is more focused and digestible. 
-   I perused the [Generative AI in the newsroom](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/) blog from Nick Diakopoulos and Jeremy Gilbert at Northwestern. 


### In-class discussions
This was easily the best part of the class. We talked about:
-   What role technology plays in their lives; they were very reflective about this (especially after reading the first half of Broussard's book).
-   How they use AI (I encouraged them to be honest, there would be no repercussions. I really wanted to hear how they approached it. A lot of this class was fact finding for me, learning from them). 
-   Bias in AI: we looked at 
    -    [examples](https://www.statnews.com/embedded-bias/) of [bias in algorithms](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210903.976632/full/) that predates AI
    -    bias in the images that [AI produces](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/)
    -    bias in the [language](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/ai-biased-against-speakers-african-american-english-study-finds) that AI produces
    -    some situations where [governmental use of AI](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ai-generated-police-reports-raise-concerns-around-transparency-bias) might worsen existing bias
-   How AI affects reality (and do we care): this was probably the most interesting and disturbing topic. It's hard to tell when you encounter [AI-generated images](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/fake-images-hurricane-survivors-bizarre-meme-rcna174874), [content](https://www.youtubeeducation.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0), [characters](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/technology/ai-chatgpt-boyfriend-companion.html), etc... and sometimes the students just [didn't care that it wasn't real](https://www.youtubeeducation.com/watch?v=dsBzEOli-p0). 
-   The environmental impact of AI. This is one of the least-discussed aspects of AI, and one of the most important (in my opinion), and my students agreed. This fundamentally changed how some of them thought about and used AI: 
	-    [AI uses a lot of energy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/)
    -    [AI uses a lot of water](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/)
    -    [Some communities are paying the price](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/01/ai-data-centers-electricity-bills-google-amazon/)


### Assignments
Creafting assignments (and then grading them) was probably the most difficult part of the class. Here are a few tips: 
-    Experiment, discuss. Experiment, discuss. I couldn't grade my students on how effectively they used AI (at least as of spring 2025, there were no guarantees that any given tool would work or do a good job at anything. So they were graded on thoroughness and reflection. 
-    Tie experimentation to newsroom: I broke my students into teams based on their school focus (print / digital, broadcast, photography, audience engagement, etc) and had them brainstorm solutions to known newsroom problems. This fostered some really interesting ideas that they then tested out. 
-    Always start with a problem, not a tool. Your assignments / experiments should not be centered around "hey this tool looks interesting", but rather "we have this problem in the newsroom, is there a way AI could help us out?" 
-    You will run into paywall issues. A lot of tools that are created for specific tasks (making games, designing websites, etc) have a fremium tier but they run out pretty quickly. Unless your class is well funded, this is just a reality.
